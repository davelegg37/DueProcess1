Stage 1 - Encounter With The LawThe first stage on the Due Process Trail starts when  an individual  first comes in contact with a law-enforcing official.  The trip begins with this encounter.  What you do in this encounter is crucial to the rest of your trip up the trail.  The constitution guarantees you certain rights as you travel up the Due Process Trail but you must be aware of the rights and exercise them.  If you act in such a way as to try to exercise your right then you will have a basis for appealing your case if you are deprived of those rights.  If, however, you waive your rights by your actions, you cannot later claim that you were denied those rights.  Thus if you waive your rights you will not a have basis for an appeal to a higher court.  You may also act, during your first encounter with the law,  in such a way such that you make your situation worse and commit crimes, either misdemeanors or felonies.  This action will end your trip up the trail and, in the case of felonies, end the game altogether by sending you to jail.




Stage 2 - Appeal to The Court
The next two stages of your trip involve  your appeal before the Appeals Court.  If you have been deprived of one of the rights guaranteed you by the constitution you may appeal your case to the Court of Appeals.  In order to do this you must determine what action taken by the authorities deprived you of your right and what right it was they deprived you of.  The action they took which denied you one of your rights will serve as the basis of your appeal.  To get the court to accept your appeal you must         correctly identify two things;. the action which deprived you of your right and. the right you were denied.
If you are unable to identify the action officials took,  which denied  your rights,  you will have no basis for your appeal.  Thus your appeal will be denied. If you are able to identify the action but unable to identify the right, which was, violated by that action your appeal will be denied.  Whatever the reason for denial of your appeal the result is the same.  When you are denied an appeal your conviction stands and you must serve your sentence.</div>

		<div>Stage 3 -  Presenting Your Case
If you both identify the action, which violated your right, and the right that was violated the Court of Appeals will hear your appeal.  When the court accepts your appeal the third and final stage of your trip up the Due Process Trail begins.  During this stage you will present your case to the Court of Appeals.   Appeals courts, unlike courts of original jurisdiction, do not consider the original actions of the case, but only consider what was wrong with the original case.  To present your case to the court you will have to do what all lawyers do and that is read the law.  Reading the law involves searching through the  law book included in the game to find previous cases where the verdict rendered by the court was similar to your case and supports your argument.   Most Judges are not really interested in your opinion but are interested in what other judges have decided in similar cases.  If you can find a case, which is similar  to your case and supports your argument, you will probably win your appeal. If you win your appeal the original conviction will be overturned.</div>
		<div>#1 US versus Rabinowitz 1950The police had a warrant for the arrest of Rabinowitz for dealing in  forged stamps at the time of the arrest the police searched his desk, safe and file cabinets and found evidence that was later used in his trial to convict him.  The court held that search did not violate the fourth amendment because he authorities have the right to search the place where an  arrest was made in order to seize things connected with the crime. Police  do not have to obtain a search warrant if they have reason to believe that the person under arrest will escape or destroy evidence of his crime before warrant can be obtained.
#2 Terry versus Ohio 1968 Officer McFadden observed three men acting in a suspicious manner outside a small store he approached the men identified himself as a police officer and frisked them. In the course of frisking the man he felt what he thought was a gun. He searched the man and found the gun which was then used as evidence in his arrest  and conviction for carrying a concealed weapon.  The court upheld the case  and use of evidence. They  stated the  act of a policeman who in the course of an investigation had to make a quick decision as to how to protect himself and others from dangers and took limited steps to do so.
#3 Weeks versus United States 1914Weeks was arrested without a warrant.  The police took from his home documents that were used as evidence against him at his trial he complained that his rights had been violated. Materials obtained as a result of an illegal search cannot be used as evidence against a citizen accused of a crime.  If letters and private documents can seized and used in evidence against a citizen accused of an offense the protection of the fourth amendment declaring his right to be secure against that searches and seizures is of no value.#4 Mapp versus Ohio 1961The Cleveland police attempted to gain access to Miss Maps home on a tip that she was harboring political radicals.  She refused them entrance because they did not have a warrant the police return three hours later and forced their way into her house and made a general search while  forcefully restraining Miss Mapp.  When she asked to see a warrent  they waved a piece of paper at her but never allowed her to see the warrant.  The police could not produce a warrant later in court. In the course of the search they found obscene materials and she was later convicted for the possession of these materials.  The Supreme Court overturned her case on the grounds of material seized in  violation of the U.S. Constitution cannot be used as evidence in court.#5 New Jersey vs TLO
Although covered by the fourth amendment public school officials for example may search a student when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school.
#6 US versus Mendenhall 1980A person is seized in a constitutional sense only when police by means of physical force or show of authority restrain that person's freedom of movement such that a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.

#7 Miranda vs Arizona 1966Ernesto Miranda was arrested and taken to the police station for forcibly raping an 18-year-old girl.  The victim picked him out in a police lineup and he was taken Into the next room and questioned.  Miranda was never apprised of his  right not to testify against himself.  No conviction will stand on  evidence introduced at the trial that has been obtained by the police as a result of custodial interrogation.  Plus unless the following conditions are met, suspects have been notified that they're free to remain silent and warned that what they say may be used against him in court tall they have a right to have attorneys present during the questioning informed that if they cannot afford to hire their own lawyers attorneys will be appointed for them and permitted at any stage of the police  interrogation which can be  terminated.
#8 Chambers versus Florida 1944Black man was convicted on the basis of the confession obtained after days of being held and questioned by the police  The Supreme Court overturned the conviction. confessions obtained by coercion are unconstitutional  coercion can be mental as well as physical and that the blood of the accused is not the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition.
#9 Versus Connecticut 1961it is the atmosphere and number police  and length of the questioning and depriving the accuser physical necessities and so forth which can force a person  to testify against himself.
#10 Malloy versus HoganMalloy convicted of illegal gambling is later asked a number of questions about the events surrounding his arrest the refused to answer pleading the fifth amendment protected him from incriminating himself.  The state held him in contempt of court and send him  to jail.  The Supreme Court ordered his release on the grounds that the 14th amendment require the states to apply the Fifth Amendment Fifth Amendment. What to applies to testimony in a federal court applies to testimony in a state court.
#11 Gideon versus Wainwright 1963 Gideon had  been convicted of breaking into a pool hall and was denied a state appointed attorney because the crime was he was accused of committing was not a capital offense. States had  previously been and required by the court to provide counsel to indigent defendants only in capital cases. Justice Hugo L  Black speaking  for the majority and Gideon stated the government hires lawyers to prosecute and defendants who have the money to hire lawyers to defend are the strongest indications of widespread belief that lawyers in criminal cases are necessities not luxuries.  The state must provide counsel for  the defendant who might be sentenced to prison.
#12 Escobito vs Illinois 1964During questioning Escobito asked the police if he could speak with his lawyer who was waiting outside.  The police refused.  Escobito then confessed to the shooting of his brother-in-law.  The pretrial confession was disallowed by the Supreme Court.  A defendant has a right to counsel at the time of questioning.
#13 Irving  versus Dowd 1961Irving had been accused of murder and the press widely reported the fact that he had confessed to committing six murders.  His lawyer was able to get a change of venue but even with the change of venue most of the members of the jury had knowledge of the reports.  Eight of the eight jury members said they thought he was guilty.  The trial was overturned because it denied Irving and impartial  trial.  Judge Clark qualified unanimous opinion overturning the trial when he wrote it was not necessary to be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.
#14 Tunney versus Ohio 1927Judges with a stake in a trial cannot judge a trial.  In this case the judge received a percentage of the fine  which he assessed against persons who came before his court.  Because he had a stake in the outcome it really ruled that person could not obtain a fair trial and impartial trial in this court.
#15 Frances versus Reed Weber 1947 Frances had been condemned to die in the electric chair.  The chair failed  twice to provide enough current to kill him. He was removed for repair of the chair.  He applied for protection from another execution on grounds of cruel and unusual punishment the court ruled in unforeseeable situation not the method of execution was cruel and thus constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment did not apply.  The cruelty against which the Constitution protects a convicted man is cruelty inherent in  the method of the punishment not necessarily suffering involved in any method employed to extinguish life humanely.
#16 RhodesThis decision limits the kinds of punishment that may be imposed for example it prohibits using torture,  intentionally denied medical care to prisoners,  holding prisoners in inhumane conditions and unnecessarily or wantonly inflicting pain.

#17 Rideau  versus LouisianaThe court held that a defendant could not receive a fair trial when a moving picture showing him confessing to the police had been shown.  The picture had been seen by three jurors but his request for a change of venue had been denied.
#18 Favor versus Noye 1963Noya and two others were convicted of murder.  The sentence of the other two men were set aside  But because he didn't go through proper procedures he   was denied access to the federal courts.  The federal court however issued a writ of habeas corpus.  Government must always be accountable for a man's imprisonment.  if the imprisonment cannot be shown to conform with fundamental requirements of law the individual is entitled to his immediate release.
#19 Brezner versus Rodriguez 1973
in refering to the writ of habeas corpus the court said over the years it has developed into a remedy available to effect discharge from any confinement contrary to the Constitution or federal law.
#20 Edwards versus Keller South Carolina 1963 College students marched to the state capital beginning a peaceful demonstration.  There were many spectators but no threat of violence.  The police concerned that the disturbance would irrupt ordered  the students to disburse.  The students refused and were arrested and convicted for breach of the peace.  The Supreme Court overturned the conviction.  You can't use the state’s charge to maintain peace in  such a broad fashion as to deprive someone of their right to peacefully assemble Justice Stewart  for the court's three petitioners were convicted of an offense so generalized as to be in the word of the South Carolina court  not susceptible of exact definition and they were convicted upon evidence that showed no more than the opinions would say were peacefully expressing was sufficiently opposed to the views of the majority community to attract a crowd and necessitate police protection.
 #21 Finer vs NYFiner was giving a speech at a street corner in Syracuse New York a large group appeared and  began to protest what he was saying.  The police asked him to stop because they feared a riot. when  he failed to stop he was arrested for breach of peace.  He appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court on the grounds that his  constitutional right of free speech he been violated but conviction was upheld. It  is one thing to say that the police cannot be used as an instrument for the suppression of popular views and another to say that when  as here the speaker passed abounds the argument of persuasion and undertakes incitement of riot their  powerless to prevent a breach of the peace.

#22 Near vs Minnesota 1930The court held an injunction against Minneapolis newspaper which  published articles criticizing government officials. The court held that the Minnesota statute and  the injunction were unconstitutional prior restraint of the press and that's a violation of the First Amendment.  The fact that for approximately 150 years there has been almost an entire absence of attempts to impose previous restraints on publications into malfeasance of public officials is significant of the deep-seated conviction that such restraints would violate constitutional rights.
#23 Kosygin versus American press company 1935The Louisiana Legislature placed at 200 percent tax on receipts of nine big-city newspapers opposed to the Long regime.  The newspaper got an injunction in federal court that said that the tax violated their freedom press and favored smaller papers not critical of government.  The Supreme Court said this just as effective prior restraint as the move directly to a gag imposed injunction against further publications.
#24 US versus Provo 1955The Court upheld the dismissal of the case which had been held up for years.  During this time many of the witnesses had disappeared.  Dismissal of the charges was the only appropriate remedy because delay resulted in protracted confinement of the defendant and disappearance of the witnesses.
#24 US versus Lasko 1977The justices rejected the argument of a defendant that he had not received the speedy trial.  Marshall wrote prosecutors do not deviate from fundamental concepts of justice when they defer seeking indictments until they have probable cause to believe and accused is guilty.
#25 Jono versus California 1969 The police had obtained a warrant for Jono’s arrest.  During a search of his house garage and workshop they found stolen coins and used them as evidence in his trial.  The court rule that Jono’s rights had  been violated.  In their decision the court set the limits of permissible searches conducted without a search warrant to lawful arrest. Police may search only the immediate area around the suspect from which he could obtain a weapon or destroy evidence a person's entire dwelling cannot be certain searched simply because he is arrested there.
#26 Stack versus Boyle 1951The court overturned a lower court ruling fixing bail at $50,000 for 12 members of the Communist Party.  In doing so it said that the right to release before trial is conditioned upon the accused giving adequate assurance that he will stand trial and submit to the sentence if found guilty,  bail set at a higher figure than an amount reasonably calculated to fulfill this purpose is excessive under the eighth amendment.
#27 US versus Watson 1976The Court upheld warrantless arrest of a suspect in public place based upon probable cause justice White stated law-enforcement officers may find it wise to seek arrest warrants where practical to do so and their judgments about probable causes may be more readily accepted or backed by a warrant issued by a magistrate.
#28 McNabb versus United States 1947The Court established the Federal rule that  under arrest a person accused of a federal crime must be taken before judicial officer for arraignment without delay.
#29 Mallory versus United States 1957The Court reversed a criminal conviction of a man interrogated and held by officials without being informed of his constitutional rights.  He was held for an unnecessary long period of time between his arrest and arraignment such practices held the court deprived him of his literature without due process of law.
#30 Tinker versus Des Moines school district 1969 Students have the right to engage in peaceful nonviolent protest the court said thereby recognizing that the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech protect symbolic as well as oral speech the school could stop  the wearing a black arm bands which did not in any way the schools disrupt the school’s work or offend the rights of others because to do so would violate the student’s freedom of speech.
#31 Gault 1966The Court extended some but not all processes privileges to juvenile court proceedings the privilege against self-incrimination the right to counsel were among the rights extended.
#32 Kopels versus LopezLopez was a student in a high school which is been experiencing extreme unrest.  As part of an attempt to quell this unrest the administration ordered an automatic suspension of students.  Lopez was  automatically suspended under this policy.  He protested claiming that he had not taken part in the protest and was not given a chance to explain his innocence.  The Supreme Court ruled that because he was not given due  process his suspension violated his constitutional rights

		<div>Guide To The Due Process Trail
Background
Statistics show that most of us at some time in our lives will take a trip on the Due Process Trail. Most of us will be accused of some type of crime and the moment that occurs we are involved in Due Process.
Due Process refers to the rights of a person who has been accused of crime and the procedures that must be followed before that person is convicted and punished for the crime.  Due Process is necessary to any system similar to  ours that presumes a person innocent until proven guilty.  It is the procedures, which all citizens are guaranteed, must be followed before a person can be punished for a crime,  breaking the law.
Although these rights and procedures are guaranteed to all citizens,  a citizen can voluntarily give up or fail to avail himself of them by taking  incorrect action during his encounter with the law.  
Your trip up the Due Process Trail involves three stages.  The  stages are sequential.  This means that you must successfully complete one stage before going on to the next.

Stage 1 - Encounter With The LawThe first stage on the Due Process Trail starts when  an individual  first comes in contact with a law-enforcing official.  The trip begins with this encounter.  What you do in this encounter is crucial to the rest of your trip up the trail.  The constitution guarantees you certain rights as you travel up the Due Process Trail but you must be aware of the rights and exercise them.  If you act in such a way as to try to exercise your right then you will have a basis for appealing your case if you are deprived of those rights.  If, however, you waive your rights by your actions, you cannot later claim that you were denied those rights.  Thus if you waive your rights you will not a have basis for an appeal to a higher court.  You may also act, during your first encounter with the law,  in such a way such that you make your situation worse and commit crimes, either misdemeanors or felonies.  This action will end your trip up the trail and, in the case of felonies, end the game altogether by sending you to jail.




Stage 2 - Appeal to The Court
The next two stages of your trip involve  your appeal before the Appeals Court.  If you have been deprived of one of the rights guaranteed you by the constitution you may appeal your case to the Court of Appeals.  In order to do this you must determine what action taken by the authorities deprived you of your right and what right it was they deprived you of.  The action they took which denied you one of your rights will serve as the basis of your appeal.  To get the court to accept your appeal you must         correctly identify two things;. the action which deprived you of your right and. the right you were denied.
If you are unable to identify the action officials took,  which denied  your rights,  you will have no basis for your appeal.  Thus your appeal will be denied. If you are able to identify the action but unable to identify the right, which was, violated by that action your appeal will be denied.  Whatever the reason for denial of your appeal the result is the same.  When you are denied an appeal your conviction stands and you must serve your sentence.

Stage 3 -  Presenting Your Case
If you both identify the action, which violated your right, and the right that was violated the Court of Appeals will hear your appeal.  When the court accepts your appeal the third and final stage of your trip up the Due Process Trail begins.  During this stage you will present your case to the Court of Appeals.   Appeals courts, unlike courts of original jurisdiction, do not consider the original actions of the case, but only consider what was wrong with the original case.  To present your case to the court you will have to do what all lawyers do and that is read the law.  Reading the law involves searching through the  law book included in the game to find previous cases where the verdict rendered by the court was similar to your case and supports your argument.   Most Judges are not really interested in your opinion but are interested in what other judges have decided in similar cases.  If you can find a case, which is similar  to your case and supports your argument, you will probably win your appeal. If you win your appeal the original conviction will be overturned.







Now To Play    -  Steps On The Due Process Trail.
Step 1   Your Original Contact With The Law.In this stage you have your first encounters with the law.  A situation will be presented and a list of actions for you to choose from.  You will receive no points for your actions in the first encounterbut failure to choose the right option here could result in your going directly to jail or losing your ability to continue up the trail to the Court of Appeals.  No points are awarded here.  They begin  when you reach the Court of Appeals.

Step 2    Appealing Your Case To The Court Of AppealsDuring this step you will attempt to get the court to accept your appeal.  The court will only accept your appeal if it is convinced that an action taken by the authorities during due process denied you a right guaranteed to you by the constitution.  You must present to the court the action and the right you feel was violated before it will accept your appeal.  If you are successful,  you will be given one point and allowed to present your case to the court.

Step 3  Presenting Your Case To The Court Of AppealsOn this step you must present your case to the Court of Appeals.  To present your case, find decisions from previous cases, which were similar to and support your case (this is called precedence).  If the court agrees with the precedent, which you have cited, it will find in your favor and the original decision in your case will be reversed.   You will receive five points if your case is reversed and will also be free to continue up another Due Process Trail.

		<div>Mapp versus Ohio 1961The Cleveland police attempted to gain access to Miss Maps home on a tip that she was harboring political radicals.  She refused them entrance because they did not have a warrant the police returned three hours later and forced their way into her house and made a general search while  forcefully restraining Miss Mapp.  When she asked to see a warrent  they waved a piece of paper at her but never allowed her to see the warrant.  The police could not produce a warrant later in court. In the course of the search they found obscene materials and she was later convicted for the possession of these materials.  The Supreme Court overturned her case on the grounds of material seized in  violation of the U.S. Constitution cannot be used as evidence in court.
</div>
		<div>Escobito vs Illinois 1964During questioning Escobito asked the police if he could speak with his lawyer who was waiting outside.  The police refused.  Escobito then confessed to the shooting of his brother-in-law.  The pretrial confession was disallowed by the Supreme Court.  A defendant has a right to counsel at the time of questioning.</div>
		<div>Near vs Minnesota 1930The court held an injunction against a Minneapolis newspaper which  published articles criticizing government officials. The court held that the Minnesota statute and  the injunction were unconstitutional prior restraint of the press and that's a violation of the First Amendment.  The fact that for approximately 150 years there has been almost an entire absence of attempts to impose previous restraints on publications as malfeasance of public officials is significant of the deep-seated conviction that such restraints would violate constitutional rights.</div>
		<div>Mallory versus United States 1957The Court reversed a criminal conviction of a man interrogated and held by officials without being informed of his constitutional rights.  He was held for an unnecessary long period of time between his arrest and arraignment, such practices held the court, deprived him of his right to due process of law.
</div>
		<div>Rideau  versus LouisianaThe court held that a defendant could not receive a fair trial when a moving picture showing him confessing to the police had been shown.  The picture had been seen by three jurors but his request for a change of venue had been denied.</div>
		<div>New Jersey vs TLOAlthough covered by the fourth amendment public school officials, for example may search a student when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school.
</div>
		<div>Kosygin versus American press company 1935The Louisiana Legislature placed a 200 percent tax on receipts of nine big-city newspapers opposed to the Long regime.  The newspaper got an injunction in federal court that said that the tax violated their freedom press and favored smaller papers not critical of government.  The Supreme Court said this was just as effective as prior restraint and imposed injunction.</div>
		<div>Tinker versus Des Moines school district 1969
"Students have the right to engage in peaceful nonviolent protest”, the court said, thereby recognizing that the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech protects symbolic as well as oral speech. The school could not stop  the wearing of black arm bands, which did not in any way disrupt the school’s work or offend the rights of others because to do so would violate the student’s freedom of speech.
</div>
		<div>Favor versus Noye 1963Noya and two others were convicted of murder.  The sentence of the other two men were set aside  but because he didn't follow proper procedures he   was denied access to the federal courts.  The federal court ,however, issued a writ of habeas corpus.  Government must always be accountable for a man's imprisonment.  if the imprisonment cannot be shown to conform with fundamental requirements of law the individual is entitled to his immediate release.</div>
		<div>US versus Mendenhall 1980

A person is seized in a constitutional sense only when police by means of physical force or show of authority restrain that person's freedom of movement such that a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.</div>
		<div>US versus Provo 1955The Court upheld the dismissal of the case which had been held up for years.  During this time many of the witnesses had disappeared.  Dismissal of the charges was the only appropriate remedy because delay resulted in protracted confinement of the defendant and disappearance of the witnesses.</div>
		<div>US versus Rabinowitz 1950 The police had a warrant for the arrest of Rabinowitz for dealing in  forged stamps. At the time of the arrest the police searched his desk, safe and file cabinets and found evidence that was later used in his trial to convict him.  The court held that the search did not violate the fourth amendment because he authorities have the right to search the place where an  arrest was made in order to seize things connected with the crime. Police  do not have to obtain a search warrant if they have reason to believe that the person under arrest will escape or destroy evidence of his crime before warrant can be obtained.
</div>
		<div>
Brezner versus Rodriguez 1973In referring to the writ of habeas corpus the court said over the years it has developed into a remedy available to effect discharge from any confinement contrary to the Constitution or federal law.
</div>
		<div>Miranda vs Arizona 1966Ernesto Miranda was arrested and taken to the police station for forcibly raping an 18-year-old girl.  The victim picked him out in a police lineup and he was taken into the next room and questioned.  Miranda was never apprised of his  right not to testify against himself.  No conviction will stand on  evidence introduced at the trial that has been obtained by the police as a result of custodial interrogation.  Plus unless the following conditions are met, suspects have been notified that they're free to remain silent and warned that what they say may be used against him in court , they have a right to have attorneys present during the questioning, informed that if they cannot afford to hire their own lawyers attorneys will be appointed for them and permitted at any stage of the police  interrogation which can be  terminated.</div>
		<div>US versus Lasko 1977The justices rejected the argument of a defendant that he had not received a speedy trial.  Marshall wrote "prosecutors do not deviate from fundamental concepts of justice when they defer seeking indictments until they have probable cause to believe and accused is guilty."</div>
		<div>Terry versus Ohio 1968 Officer McFadden observed three men acting in a suspicious manner outside a small store. He approached the men identified himself as a police officer and frisked them. In the course of frisking the man he felt what he thought was a gun. He searched the man and found the gun which was then used as evidence in his arrest  and conviction for carrying a concealed weapon.  The court upheld the case  and use of evidence. They  stated the  act of a policeman who in the course of an investigation had to make a quick decision as to how to protect himself and others from dangers and took limited steps to do so.
</div>
		<div>Irving  versus Dowd 1961Irving had been accused of murder and the press widely reported the fact that he had confessed to committing six murders.  His lawyer was able to get a change of venue but even with the change of venue most of the members of the jury had knowledge of the reports.  Eight of the eight jury members said they thought he was guilty.  The trial was overturned because it denied Irving and impartial  trial.  Judge Clark qualified unanimous opinion overturning the trial when he wrote it was not necessary to be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.</div>
		<div>Edwards versus Keller South Carolina 1963College students marched to the state capital beginning a peaceful demonstration.  There were many spectators but no threat of violence.  The police concerned that the disturbance would irrupt ordered  the students to disburse.  The students refused and were arrested and convicted for breach of the peace.  The Supreme Court overturned the conviction.  "You can't use the state’s charge to maintain peace in  such a broad fashion as to deprive someone of their right to peacefully assemble" said Justice Stewart  for the court. These three petitioners were convicted of an offense so generalized as to be in the word of the South Carolina court  not susceptible of exact definition and they were convicted upon evidence that showed the opinions they were peacefully expressing were sufficiently opposed to the views of the majority community to attract a crowd and necessitate police protection.
</div>
		<div>Chambers versus Florida 1944
A black man was convicted on the basis of the confession obtained after days of being held and questioned by the police  The Supreme Court overturned the conviction. Confessions obtained by coercion are unconstitutional.  Coercion can be mental as well as physical and that the blood of the accused is not the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition.
</div>
		<div>Jono versus California 1969The police had obtained a warrant for Jono’s arrest.  During a search of his house garage and workshop they found stolen coins and used them as evidence in his trial.  The court ruled that Jono’s rights had  been violated.  In their decision the court set the limits of permissible searches conducted without a search warrant to lawful arrest. Police may search only the immediate area around the suspect from which he could obtain a weapon or destroy evidence a person's entire dwelling cannot be certain searched simply because he is arrested there.</div>
		<div>Tunney versus Ohio 1927Judges with a stake in a trial cannot judge a trial.  In this case the judge received a percentage of the fine  which he assessed against persons who came before his court.  Because he had a stake in the outcome it ruled that person could not obtain a fair trial and impartial trial in this court.</div>
		<div>Finer was giving a speech at a street corner in Syracuse New York and a large group appeared and  began to protest what he was saying.  The police asked him to stop because they feared a riot. When  he failed to stop he was arrested for breach of peace.  He appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court on the grounds that his  constitutional right of free speech he been violated but conviction was upheld. It  is one thing to say that the police cannot be used as an instrument for the suppression of popular views and another to say that when,  as here the speaker passed the boundaries of argument and persuasion and undertakes incitement of riot their  powerless to prevent a breach of the peace.
</div>
		<div>Gault 1966The Court extended some, but not all processes and privileges to juvenile court proceedings. The privilege against self-incrimination and the right to counsel were among the rights extended.</div>
		<div>Versus Connecticut 1961It is the atmosphere and number police  and length of the questioning and depriving the accuser physical necessities and so forth which can force a person  to testify against himself.</div>
		<div>Stack versus Boyle 1951The court overturned a lower court ruling fixing bail at $50,000 for 12 members of the Communist Party.  In doing so it said that the right to release before trial is conditioned upon the accused giving adequate assurance that he will stand trial and submit to the sentence if found guilty,  bail set at a higher figure than an amount reasonably calculated to fulfill this purpose is excessive under the eighth amendment.</div>
		<div>Frances versus Reed Weber 1947Frances had been condemned to die in the electric chair.  The chair failed  twice to provide enough current to kill him. He was removed for repair of the chair.  He applied for protection from another execution on grounds of cruel and unusual punishment the court ruled in unforeseeable situation not the method of execution was cruel and thus constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment did not apply.  The cruelty against which the Constitution protects a convicted man is cruelty inherent in  the method of the punishment not necessarily suffering involved in any method employed to extinguish life humanely.</div>
		<div>Kopels versus LopezLopez was a student in a high school which had been experiencing extreme unrest.  As part of an attempt to quell this unrest the administration ordered an automatic suspension of students.  Lopez was  automatically suspended under this policy.  He protested claiming that he had not taken part in the protest and was not given a chance to explain his innocence.  The Supreme Court ruled that because he was not given due  process his suspension violated his constitutional rights</div>
		<div>Malloy versus HoganMalloy convicted of illegal gambling was later asked a number of questions about the events surrounding his arrest. He refused to answer pleading the fifth amendment protected him from incriminating himself.  The state held him in contempt of court and send him  to jail.  The Supreme Court ordered his release on the grounds that the 14th amendment require the states to apply the Fifth Amendment Fifth Amendment. What to applies to testimony in a federal court applies to testimony in a state court..
</div>
		<div>US versus Watson 1976The Court upheld warrantless arrest of a suspect in a public place based upon probable cause. Justice White stated law-enforcement officers may find it wise to seek arrest warrants where practical to do so and their judgments about probable causes may be more readily accepted or backed by a warrant issued by a magistrate.

He was removed for repair of the chair.  He applied for protection from another execution on grounds of cruel and unusual punishment the court ruled in unforeseeable situation not the method of execution was cruel and thus constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment did not apply.  The cruelty against which the Constitution protects a convicted man is cruelty inherent in  the method of the punishment not necessarily suffering involved in any method employed to extinguish life humanely</div>
		<div>Weeks versus United States 1914 Weeks was arrested without a warrant.  The police took from his home, documents that were used as evidence against him at his trial. He complained that his rights had been violated. Materials obtained as a result of an illegal search cannot be used as evidence against a citizen accused of a crime.  If letters and private documents can seized and used in evidence against a citizen accused of an offense the protection of the fourth amendment declaring his right to be secure against that searches and seizures is of no value.
</div>
		<div>Gideon versus Wainwright 1963 Gideon had  been convicted of breaking into a pool hall and was denied a state appointed attorney because the crime he was accused of committing was not a capital offense. States had  previously been and required by the court to provide counsel to indigent defendants only in capital cases. Justice Hugo L  Black speaking  for the majority and Gideon stated the government hires lawyers to prosecute and defendants who have the money to hire lawyers to defend are the strongest indications of widespread belief that lawyers in criminal cases are necessities not luxuries.  The state must provide counsel for  the defendant who might be sentenced to prison.</div>
		<div>McNabb versus United States 1947The Court established the Federal rule that  under arrest a person accused of a federal crime must be taken before a judicial officer for arraignment without delay.</div>
		<div>Rhodes versus Chapman 1981This decision limits the kinds of punishment that may be imposed for example it prohibits using torture,  intentionally denied medical care to prisoners,  holding prisoners in inhumane conditions and unnecessarily or wantonly inflicting pain.</div>
